 1.4 
 
 + Added a new block vault, it's a 2x2x1 rectangle (WxHxD).
 + Added a pattern for block vault , by placing two next to each other and two on top you create a bigger vault that contains 54 slots.
 + You can now add 5 friends to your vault, and they can open it and share their stuff with you.
 + Same for the 2x2 vault.
 + Added a GUI settings for the block vault, usable only for the owner in the top corner right on the GUI of your vault, it allows you to see who can access the vault and you can remove them by clicking the cross next to their name.
 + For the new feature above, the other player must be near you and in the same world or the GUI won't detect him.
 + Added packet of every bills, 9 bills will now give you a packet.
 + Added a new model and new texture for the block vault, if there are some stuff inside, the block change texture inside and contain some bills and gold bar. This will be a future implementation for the animation of the vault.
 + Huge modification, money is now saved in a capabality on server side, which mean that player in multiplayer don't have the amount of money stored on client, but at every connection this data is synchronized from server to client.
   It is a huge modification, because, first there is only one money capabality, so on every credit card that the player will create, he'll have the same amount, the amount of his capabaility stored on server. Second, this is way more secure that way, the client don't send
   anymore packets to server to notify of the change, but that's the server who will notify the client. That way only server can modify the value, and administrators if they have the right tool to read the files and modify it. In singleplayer it works the same way but with the internal server of the game,
   as you may know, when connecting to your client world, you launch a internal server that handle lots of stuff.
 + Command balance will now return the capability of the player and it's not necessary for the player to have his card in the inventory to check it.
 + You can now leave your card in your safe if you have the wireless upgrade. You can directly pay by clicking on buy. Capabilities will handle the change of amount and will synchronize it with your credit card.
 + Added name and translation for the different languages.
 + When you hover an item into the mod's GUI it will now display what it is and the item's NBT, which was not implemented yet.
 * Fixed problem with the text inside GUI that were bigger than the actual GUI.
 * Switched button in the item credit card, now + add money, and - remove money from card.
 + When a seller is empty and you try to buy it will now notify you that it's empty.
 * Changed the GUI changer background image.
 * Changed texture of the block changer.
 * Changed texture of gear.
 * Changed texture of gear mechanism.
 + Added a function that will show in GUI and in block seller a barrier block if the stock is sold out.
 + Added a ATM block.
 - Removed the fact that you can access your account directly by right clicking with the credit card except if there is the wireless technology implemented.
 - Removed the delete GUI. (It was useless)
 + Added a feature in the configuration file to allow players to open their inventories or not if they have the wireless technology.

 + Added a configuration to disable bank will generation in villages, by default it generates.

 1.4.5
 
 * Fixed the crash with the seller !
 
 1.5
 
 @ Cleaning code. 
 + There is now a server configuration file different on server and client, for the configurations that are both on server/client it will take the server one.
 + Added a configuration to remove the gold nugget from the MOD and thus the gold exchange machine.
 + Added a new GUI for the vault in bank.
 + Using the digital cracker will now remove durability from it (5 uses), after a try it closes the GUI if it is no the right code.
 + Added a new villager, the informer, there is only one trade with it. For 100 dollars he will give you the code of the bank's vault, but who know what's inside..
 + Added AI to the informer, he acts just like a villager but he is not one, he actually don't like them.
 + Added MySQL. This is a huge add, on the server configuration file you can now allow the server to connect to your database. When the server start you will have a message saying if the database was created 
   successfully or if there is already one it will give you an error message which is normal. 
 + Added when a player connect to the server and if he is not registered it will do it and will put his status on ONLINE.
 + Added when the player disconnect from the server, the money will sync up and his status will be put on OFFLINE.
 + Added a true/false column called syncBDDtoSERV on SQL, if the value pass to 1 at the connection of the player it will sync up the new amount of money. The player needs to be disconnected FIRST (checkable via the status) and at his connection the syncBDDtoSERV will pass to 0 again.
 @ WARNING : Use the last column with precautions, it should be used in rare case AT THE MOMENT. I'm not responsible for the damage it could cause to your database in any case.
   A video tutorial will normally follow this update in French and English.

 + Added a command plot buy, that allows players to buy with wireless technology to buy plots.
 * Fixed recipes.
 * Fixed the block vault not displaying the model of the pad on it.
 * Fixed the gold nugget recipe. You will now get a pure gold nugget by smelting the gold ingot. Instead of having a gold nugget from the gold ore.
 @ MYSQL is implemented but very unstable, I don't recommend using it yet.
 * Fixed a block changer feedback that was not sent when a player is already using the block and gave an error in the server output. It should now display the error to the player trying to open the block changer already used.
 * Fixed Capability related stuff for money handling saving/writing/reading.
